#Use DNase I Seq data to predict Reprogramming Transcription Factors

#The gene regulatory regions such as the enhancers play an important role in determine ceullular state. The accessibility of the enhancer can be dtermined by a set of transcription factors which is called the reprogramming transcription factors. The DNase I Seq data can be used to detect the accessible DNA regions. Here, we use the DNase I Seq data to detect the target cell specific accessible DNA regions and predict the corresponding reprogramming transcription factor (RTF) in the system.
